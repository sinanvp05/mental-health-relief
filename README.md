mental health issues and promote wellbeing. The website will comprise of a Q&A, Articles and Books regarding mental health, Channel Therapies and games for 
reduce stress. The website will have a user management system to manage the users in the site. The website will also 
be made in a user friendly and a simple manner to ensure minimal distraction and stress on the user. Website is designed to maximize the user 
engagement so that we can provide accurate feedback and relevant details for the user. The website will you the data from the users to accurately 
predict and develop the website to increase efficiency of the website. As students of SLIIT we have consulted a medical doctor and have used 
his input to develop the website. We believe that good mental health and proper well-being will raise the standards of living for people in Sri Lanka and all over the world. Because of this website collects personal data from users, we will not sell any of the data to third parties.
